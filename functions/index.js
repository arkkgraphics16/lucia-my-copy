      <p><strong>Privacy you can trust:</strong> All your conversations are encrypted before leaving your device. We cannot read them. Only you control your content.</p>

      <p>Lucía helps you find context and perspective through what we call <em>Digital Intuition</em>. To do this, she sometimes extracts a lot from almost nothing — she was designed to infer deeply, even from small details you may not be consciously aware of.</p>

      <p>She also includes a random, statistical component in her reasoning. That means sometimes she feels almost magical when she gets it right, while other times she may add a little noise or lose coherence. This will never be fully removed — and that’s what makes her unique.</p>

      <p>It’s also important to know that the underlying AI never gives the same answer twice. This variability is not even under our control — and that’s why we emphasize: Lucía is context, not absolute truth.</p>

      <p>Most of the time she will be very accurate, but her true value is not to predict everything exactly. Her real contribution is to provide context and illuminate blind spots — things that your own bias, personality, past experiences, or background might never let you see.</p>

      <p>Think of her like GPS: she guides you, but you remain the driver. You don’t drive off a cliff just because the map says the road continues, and you don’t enter a path too narrow for cars only because it looks shorter. You always keep your own judgment.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <p><strong>Your rights:</strong> You can request deletion of your email and account data at any time. Just send a message to our support team at <a href="mailto:${BRAND.supportEmail}">${BRAND.supportEmail}</a>, and we will remove it.</p>
