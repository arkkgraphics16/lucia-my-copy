            <h2>1. The Service</h2>
            <p>
              LUCIA is an AI-powered assistant that provides context and perspective to users’ situations through what we call
              <strong> Digital Intuition</strong>. LUCIA infers meaning from minimal details, may sometimes generate responses that feel highly
              accurate, and at other times may introduce noise or lose coherence. LUCIA also includes a random, statistical component in her reasoning.
              The underlying AI never gives the same answer twice, and this variability is not under our control. LUCIA’s role is to highlight blind
              spots and create perspective. She does not provide medical, legal, or financial advice. You should not rely on her outputs as absolute truth,
              and you remain responsible for your decisions. A helpful analogy: LUCIA is like GPS navigation — she guides you, but you remain the driver.
              You don’t drive off a cliff just because the map says the road continues, and you don’t enter a path too narrow for cars only because it looks shorter.

            <h2>2. Free Tier and Plans</h2>
            <h3>2A. Fair Use for the Total plan</h3>
            <p>
              To protect service quality and sustainability, the <strong>Total</strong> plan is subject to fair-use limits. Abnormal or disproportionate usage
              that materially exceeds typical patterns for an individual user (for example, automated message flooding, unusually high request rates, or
              consumption that significantly degrades the experience for others) may be temporarily throttled. Where reasonable, we will notify you and may
              suggest a plan change. If usage continues to exceed fair-use thresholds after notice, we may apply additional charges that we disclose to you
              in advance, or suspend access to restore normal service levels. These measures also help us comply with our AI provider’s rate-limits and service policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              LUCIA offers a free tier that includes 10 messages per user, with 2 additional courtesy messages so you don’t lose your thread. We may adjust
              these limits or introduce subscription plans in the future.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>3. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p>
              Your use of LUCIA must also comply with our AI provider’s usage policies and service terms. If our provider restricts or suspends access due to
              policy or rate-limit violations, we may need to limit, throttle, or suspend your access accordingly. You agree not to use LUCIA to engage in
              illegal activities, transmit harmful or abusive content, or attempt to interfere with the system’s operation. We reserve the right to suspend or
              terminate accounts that violate these terms.

            <h2>5. Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>
              LUCIA is provided “as is.” While we strive for accuracy, outputs may be incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent. We disclaim all warranties to the
              maximum extent permitted by law. LUCIA does not provide medical, legal, or financial advice. Any outputs are for context and perspective only.
              All decisions remain the sole responsibility of the user. <strong>Outputs are provided for context and perspective only, and must not be relied upon
              as a substitute for professional advice of any kind.</strong>

              To use LUCIA, you must register for an account using either Google Sign-In, email and password, or email link. You are responsible for maintaining
              the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account. LUCIA is not liable for unauthorized use of your

            <h3>Fair-Use Enforcement Metrics</h3>
            <p>
              To enforce fair-use for the Total plan and protect availability, we process limited usage metadata (for example, message counts, token totals,
              request rate, and plan tier). This does not involve reading your message content, which remains end-to-end encrypted as stated below.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your messages are encrypted before leaving your device and stored in Firebase Firestore. Administrators cannot read your threads, prompts, past
              conversations, or see deleted chats. While we guarantee privacy on our side, we do not control how OpenAI may process text to generate responses.
              You have the right to request deletion of your email and account data at any time by contacting
              {' '}<a href="mailto:lucia.decode@proton.me">lucia.decode@proton.me</a>.
